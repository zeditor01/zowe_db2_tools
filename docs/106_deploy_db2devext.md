# Step 6. Deploying Db2 for z/OS Developer Extension in VSCODE

The Zowe infrastructure for DB2 tools is aimed at Database Administrator roles. The beauty of the Zowe foundation is that a unified graphical user interface can be provided without installing any software outside of z/OS.

Developers will be using an IDE, which is pretty likely to be VSCODE. They will want to test and tune SQL from inside their development IDE. For this reason, IBM has developed the Db2 for z/OS Developer extension for VSCODE. It contains SQL editing support, SQL tuning by calling SQL Tuning Services, stored procedure development and debugging, Catalog navigation, table editing and more.

this page describes setiing up Db2 for z/OS Developer Extension in VSCODE, and connecting to SQL Tuning Services.
