# Assumed ZPDT Deployment

This GitHub repository assumes that your environment ( whether ZPDT or real IBM Z Server ) is setup to allow your client to access z/OS via 3 standard interfaces.
1. Web Browser, to access z/OSMF, Zowe, UMS, QWT Liberty Server etc...
2. command prompt that support ssh connection to z/OS
3. 3270 emulator to logon to TSO

The worked examples in this repository assume that z/OS is accessible via 
* TCPIP address 192.168.1.171
* or Hostname s0w1.dal-ebis.ihost.com

If your IP address or hostname is different, you will need to adjust your work to reflect these differences.
