# QWT Customise

The process of customising a product after it is installed varies from product to product.

* Traditionally for a 3270-based Db2 tool, it would typically mean editing the site's ISPF menus to provide a link to the ISPF menus of the new product, and providing connection and authorisation details to attach to Db2 z/OS subsytems.
* QWT is more modern. It does not have any 3270 panels. It runs inside a Liberty server, and is accessed by RESTful API calls from VSCODE or Zowe. So the customisation steps for QWT involve setting up a Liberty server, and configuring TCPIP connections and RACF certificates to make those connections secure.

This GitHub page is just a worked example, with screenshots and a sequential narrative that is hopefully easy to follow. You should familiarise yourself with the product documentation. The links below are what you need.

## QWT Architecture

The links above include a good architecture diagram, shown below. 
* The central engine of QWT is the Tuning Services Server, which is a Liberty server running in USS.
* It's metadata is stored in a Repository Database, which resides in a Db2 z/OS subsystem.
* It can be used to tune SQL in any connectable Db2 z/OS subsystem (including the Repository Database).
* It supports Tuning request via RESTful API calls from Zowe and VSCODE.
