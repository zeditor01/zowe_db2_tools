# 3.1 DAF and UMS : Shop Z Download

## Scope of this page

This page provides a worked example of downloading the Portable Software Instance of Query Workload Tuner (DAF and UMS) from ShopZ download server to your z/OS image.

## Starting point

It is assumed that you have already ordered QWT from ShopZ. The order should provide you with a SERVER XML block that allows you to perform a secure download from Shop Z. 

The ShopZ download credentials are valid for a short period, and these ones have since expired. You need to order your copy of QWT through ShopZ using your company's login account.
