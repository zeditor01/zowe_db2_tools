# 3.1 DAF and UMS : Shop Z Download

## Scope of this page

This page provides a worked example of downloading the Portable Software Instance of Db2 Administration Foundation and Unified Management Server (DAF and UMS) from ShopZ download server to your z/OS image.

## Starting point

It is assumed that you have already ordered DAF and UMS from ShopZ. The order should provide you with a SERVER XML block that allows you to perform a secure download from Shop Z. 

The ShopZ download credentials are valid for a short period, and these ones have since expired. You need to order your copy of QWT through ShopZ using your company's login account.



```
=== Order Size and File System Size Information ========================
                                                                        
The size of your order is 819 MB                                        
                                                                        
You need space in the file system used by z/OSMF Software Management    
Add Portable Software Instance for approximately twice the size of your 
order. To convert to 3390 cylinders, multiply the number of MB by 1.25  
and then multiply by 2.                                                 
                                                                        
For example, for a size of 5000 MB, then:                               
( (5,000 MB) * (1.25 CYL/MB) ) * 2 = 12,500 cylinders                   
                                                                        
== Server XML for Add Portable Software Instance From Download Server ==
You can copy the below statements into the z/OSMF Software Management   
Server XML box.
