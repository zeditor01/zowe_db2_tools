After installing Zowe, you will have a landscape like this.

Now we wish to Deploy the Unified Management Server and Db2 Administration Foundation into Zowe.
1. install UMS and DAF code. (it makes sense to install DAF and UMS together).
2. edit ZWEYAML parmlib member to configure UMS to integrate with z/OS and Zowe'
3. Execute the UMS installation workflows (including integration of zowe.yaml with UMS ZWEYAML.
4. start the zowe server (and likely debug initial UMS startup problems).
6. test Zowe from a web browser.
