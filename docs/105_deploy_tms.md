# Step 5 Deploying SQL Tuning Services

SQL Tuning Services for Db2 z/OS is independent of the Zowe infrastructure, but can be accessed from Db2 Administration Foundation by configuring access to the SQL Tuning Server's RESTful APIs.

Db2 Administration Administration Foundation has a relatively simple set of catalog browsing capabilities by itself. If you have Db2 Administration Tool installed, then you can configure UMS to "discover" additional tools capabilities from Db2 Administration Tool, and expose them to Db2 Administration Foundation.
