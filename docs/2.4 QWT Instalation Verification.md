# QWT User Setup and Installation Verification

The previous pages have covered (a) Download of QWT PSI (b) Deployment of QWT PSI and (c) Customisation of QWT to run as a Server.

The Next step is to Start the QWT Server, and set it up for Users.


## Start the QWT Started Task

Go to SDSF and issue the command to start the QWT started task. ( s DSN5STRT )

![qwtstart](/images/qwtstart.jpg)

Go to SDSF DA and check that it is running

![qwtstart2](/images/qwtstart2.jpg)

View the SDSF output and observe the messages

![qwtstart3](/images/qwtstart3.jpg)

After a while, you will see the messages that the TMS1 server is ready to run a smarter planet. That means that the Libery Server is up an running. It is followed by the startup messages for Tuning Services.

When you see the  TuningServce Initialization Successful message, you know that Liberty and QWT are up and running.

## User Setup with the Swagger APIs

Open a browser. (prefer Firefox) and point it at ```https://s0w1.dal-ebis.ihost.com:15001/tuningservice/v1/swagger-ui/index.html```

Check that your browser opens the page with a secure connection. If the connection is marked insecure ( a red https:// in the URL bar ) then it is probably because you haven't previously imported the CA Certificate into your trusted root certificates store. In this case you should export the CA Certificate (Label BaseCA), save it to your PC, and import it into your trusted root certificates store.

Note that QWT does not have an HTML home page. It provides an HTML page to review and invoke the various REST APIs that it serves. We will use these REST APIs to complete the user setup.

Tools such as Zowe and VSCODE will connect to QWT with regular authentication methods ( password, passticket etc... ) and QWT will generate a token that will persist for the durations of the connected session. In order to complete user setup, we need to use the same approach to using the APIs for a session. Click on the "Post" method to Generate Token. The Swagger page will describe the API, and offer you a "Try it Out" button.

![ivp_qwt_02](/images/ivp_qwt_02.jpg)

Push the "Try it Out" button, and enter the JSON input parameters ( userid TMSUSER, password TMSPASS ) and press "Execute". 

When it completes, scroll down to the Responses section. Hopefully it is a return code 200 (success), and a JSON body with the token. Copy the generated token into the clipboard.

![ivp_qwt_03](/images/ivp_qwt_03.jpg)

Now click on the Green Padlock (top tight), type in the word "Bearer" followed by one ( and only one ! ) space. Then paste the token into the rest of the field, and press "Authorize"

![ivp_qwt_04](/images/ivp_qwt_04.jpg)

The box will say "Authorized". Click the "Close" button to continue your authorized session with the QWT Server.
