# 3.4 DAF and UMS : Installation Verification

Installing software for z/OS typically involves 4 Steps
1. Download the Portable Software Instance (PSI) from ShopZ to a ZFS file system on z/OS
2. Deploy the PSI (unpack it into the target z/OS datasets, and adjust z/OS parameters)
3. Customize the Software (creating instances of it, configuring connections, setting up ISPF panels etc...)
4. Installation Verification Testing  <<<--- This page



## Scope of this page

This page provides a worked example of testing the basic functionality of (DAF and UMS).


## Starting point

Continuing from the Customization of DAF and UMS, we were logged on the Zowe, and about to launch the Unified Management Server app.

![ivp_dafums_01](/images/ivp_dafums_01.jpg)

UMS automatically discovers our Db2 z/OS subsystem. We need to select it and press "Register"

![ivp_dafums_02](/images/ivp_dafums_02.jpg)

There are two pages of configuration information to fill in. The system page is about TCPIP connectivity.

![ivp_dafums_03](/images/ivp_dafums_03.jpg)

And the second page is about configuration.

![ivp_dafums_04](/images/ivp_dafums_04.jpg)

Press "Register" (or "Update" if it's a second attempt) and the dashboard tells you it is Processing. Behind the scenes it kicks off a job to connect and bind packages.

![ivp_dafums_05](/images/ivp_dafums_05.jpg)

If you get an error, press on the link to the messages

![ivp_dafums_06](/images/ivp_dafums_06.jpg)

you will be shown the Job Name and Number that was invoked.

![ivp_dafums_07](/images/ivp_dafums_07.jpg)

Go to SDSF and find the job. Look in the messages and find the reason. I had entered the wrong load library names, resulting in the program not being able to find DSNTEP2, and such things.

![ivp_dafums_08](/images/ivp_dafums_08.jpg)

Return to the App, and make changes, and Press Update.

![ivp_dafums_09](/images/ivp_dafums_09.jpg)

After correcting the errors, you should be Ready.

![ivp_dafums_10](/images/ivp_dafums_10.jpg)

Navigate to "Explore" and "Objects. Enter Search criteria, such as Tables in Subsystem DBDG.

![ivp_dafums_11](/images/ivp_dafums_11.jpg)

Press Apply to see the outputs.

Then play around with Catalog Navigation.

![ivp_dafums_12](/images/ivp_dafums_12.jpg)

Navigate to the SQL submission pages, and enter an SQL query, and press "Run"

![ivp_dafums_13](/images/ivp_dafums_13.jpg)

Check for valid results.

![ivp_dafums_14](/images/ivp_dafums_14.jpg)


That's enough of a basic Installation Verification Program.

Next we will progress to intrgating Db2 Administration Foundation with other tools, like Db2 Administration Tool and Query Workload Tuner.
